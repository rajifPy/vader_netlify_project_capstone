   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```
2. From project root, install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run locally (this serves static site and functions):
   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```
   - Open `http://localhost:8888` (or as printed).  
   - Functions are available under `/.netlify/functions/*`
